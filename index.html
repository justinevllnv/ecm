      <p> The expedition made its second and final assault on the summit with
        its second climbing pair, the New Zealander <strong>Edmund Hillary</strong>
        and <strong>Tenzing Norgay</strong>, a Nepali Sherpa climber.
        <br>They reached the summit at 11:30 local time on 29 May 1953 via the South
        Col route. At the time, both acknowledged it as a team effort by the
        whole expedition, but Tenzing revealed a few years later that Hillary
        had put his foot on the summit first. They paused at the summit to take
        photographs and buried a few sweets and a small cross in the snow
        before descending.</p>
